## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will utilize scraped data from the IMDB online database to implement a searchable and customizable user profile. Users will be able to login, create, edit and annotate, a profile detailing a list of their favorite movies.
### Features
1.	User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

2.	Movie search: Users will be able to search for specific movies, and data about those movies, and will be able to save specific movie data to their own movie list profile. 

3.	Create, edit, and annotate movie list entry: While logged in, users will be able to create new movie entries for their list of favorite movies, and will be able to annotate entries as they so desire. 
### Technologies
Technologies would include, but are not limited to, Python, Django, Scrapy (open-source web-crawling framework written in Python), MySQL, and either Angular or ASP.NET MVC. Maybe BeautifulSoup. 
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to write a simple basic web-scraping program using Python as well as how to use Scrapy, which includes an HTML parser.
